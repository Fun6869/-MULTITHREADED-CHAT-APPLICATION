This is a package that is implicitly imported in every Java program. It contains fundamental classes such as String, Thread, Exception, and System.

**HOW TO RUN**

1.Run the Server:
-Right-click on the Server.java file in the Project pane.
-Select Run 'Server.main()'.
-The server should start running and wait for incoming client connections on port 1234.
-You will see something like A new client has connected! in the Run tab in IntelliJ when a client connects.
2. Run the Clients:
-You need to run the Client.java class in separate instances (one for each client).
-Right-click on the Client.java file and select Run 'Client.main()'.
-The first client will open, and it will prompt you to enter a username (e.g., Alice).
-To simulate another client, you can either open another instance of IntelliJ or run a new Run Configuration in the same IntelliJ window:
-Just modify to allow multiple instaces which will allow us to create many clients

After doing this our chat application is ready
